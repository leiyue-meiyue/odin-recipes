        <li>
            4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon butter
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (14 ounce) can marinated quartered artichoke hearts, drained,
            liquid reserved
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup white wine
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon capers
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a 
            large skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken in oil and butter 
            for 5 to 7 minutes per side; remove from skillet, and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place artichoke hearts and mushrooms in the skillet, and saute 
                until mushrooms are brown and tender. Return chicken to skillet, 
                and pour in reserved artichoke liquid and wine. Reduce heat to 
                low, and simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until chicken is no 
                longer pink and juices run clear.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir in capers, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from 
                heat; serve immediately.
