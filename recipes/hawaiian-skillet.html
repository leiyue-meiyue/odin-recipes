            <p>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir 
                sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start 
                to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 
                5 minutes more.
            </p>

                Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl 
                using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, 
                and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the 
                sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage 
                mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.
